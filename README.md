Developed a Streamlit-based web application that automates cold email generation using web scraping and NLP (Langchain, ChatGroq) to extract job descriptions and create personalized outreach emails.

Streamlit web application designed to generate cold emails by analyzing job postings from a given URL. Here's a breakdown of the code:

### `main.py`
- This is the entry point of the Streamlit app.
- **Key Features**:
  - Displays a title and a text input box where users can enter a URL to a job posting.
  - Once the URL is submitted, the app scrapes the webpage, extracts job information using the `Chain` class, and matches relevant portfolio links using the `Portfolio` class.
  - Finally, it generates a cold email (using a language model, likely via Langchain's ChatGroq) that aligns with the job description and portfolio links.

### `chains.py`
- Contains the `Chain` class which interacts with a large language model (`llama-3.1-70b-versatile` from Groq).
- **Key Features**:
  - It loads the language model, which extracts job-related details from the text scraped from the job posting.
  - It generates an email by combining job details with portfolio links through a defined prompt structure.
  - This uses prompt chaining, invoking the language model to extract jobs and generate the email text.

### `portfolio.py`
- Manages the portfolio information, likely a CSV with a collection of technical skills and links to previous projects.
- **Key Features**:
  - Loads the portfolio data into a vector database (ChromaDB).
  - Matches job skills from the scraped job description to the portfolio's tech stack.
  - Retrieves relevant links that can be included in the cold email, making the email personalized and targeted.

### **Project Overview & Strengths**:
- The app automates cold email generation by scraping job descriptions and customizing outreach based on relevant portfolio projects.
- It integrates cutting-edge NLP techniques (ChatGroq and Langchain) to streamline job scraping and email writing.
- The use of ChromaDB for querying portfolio information adds a strong personalized touch by matching the companyâ€™s tech stack with job requirements.

### **Areas to Enhance**:
1. **Error Handling**: The main script handles errors at the top level, but more granular error handling (e.g., for scraping failures or database issues) could help improve user experience.
2. **Documentation**: Adding comments to clarify the purpose of each method (especially in `chains.py`) would make the code more maintainable.
3. **Flexibility for Different Job Sites**: The URL scraping is currently hardcoded for one format; adding more flexible parsing techniques could expand its usability to other job platforms.
4. **Environment Variables**: The API key for ChatGroq is loaded from an environment variable (`GROQ_api_KEY`). Ensure this is securely managed in deployment.
